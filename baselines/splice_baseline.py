def run_splice_baseline(clip_wrapper, original_embeddings, train_loader, cfg, device):
    """
    Implements the SpLiCE baseline for latent space editing,
    performing targeted semantic manipulation of w_sparse weights.

    Args:
        clip_wrapper: An instance of CLIPModelWrapper (not directly used for SpLiCE's
                      decomposition/recomposition but may be useful for mapping concepts).
        original_embeddings (torch.Tensor): The embeddings of the test set images
                                            that need to be edited.
        train_loader (torch.utils.data.DataLoader): DataLoader for the training set (not directly used
                      by SpLiCE's manipulation API here, but could be for learning concept
                      strengths if needed in a more complex SpLiCE implementation).
        cfg (dict): Configuration dictionary, containing 'concept' (positive/negative)
                    and 'surgery_alpha' for the manipulation factor.
        device (str): The device ('cuda' or 'cpu') to perform computations on.

    Returns:
        torch.Tensor: The embeddings after applying the SpLiCE transformation
                      with targeted semantic edits.
